I am currecnt a student at California Polytecnic State University pursuing a B.S. Chemisry degree. Before transferring to CalPoly I went to Cerritos College where I recieved my Associates in Science Degree in Chemistry, Physics, and Math as well as my General Associate in Arts Degree in Natural Sciences.

### More Information

When I am not studying, I enjoy spending time with friends and family. I enjoy cooking and trying new places to eat as well as spending time outdoors and practicing yoga. I am a big animal lover so any chance I get to see or be around animals brings me happiness.
